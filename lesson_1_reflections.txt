How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It quickly showed what was different rather than having to do it manually which was more difficult to catch errors.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term.
You can remember all the things you tried.  You can go back to a decision point when you have gone down the wrong branch.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

you need to be mindful as to what is a logical commit

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Most of the other systems view the document as the total project and do not have a construct for multiple files

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log let's you find the correct version and then the diff commands allows you to compare two files and find what you changed in the more recent version

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

You know you can always go back and change a decision you made in an orderly systematic fashion
